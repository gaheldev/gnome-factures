Refactoring
    * everything related to billing_view inside a BillInfo type
    * encapsulate author, bill_info, client and products into a Bill type

Improvement
    * allow to select and edit authors like client ?
    * allow to select different "profiles" (config file)
        -> requires to update app with config file
    * everything on a single page

FIXME:
    * editing client name creates new client
